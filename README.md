# Communication1-Labs
Here, I uploaded the codes that I have written during the Communication 1 lecture, which was given at the Ä°zmir Institute of Technology Electronics and Communication Department.

-LAB 1-
-------

In the first lab's first part, we applied FFT to the message signals. In the second part, we used MATLAB's ifft() function and performed IFFT by convolving signals and the results have been tested by taking two results differences.

-LAB 2-
-------

First, we constructed the given signals. After that, different types of filters are applied to the constructed signals. The used filters are Ideal Low-Pass Filter, Ideal Band-Pass Filter, and Butter Band-Pass Filter (nonideal).

-LAB 3-
-------

In lab 3, we practiced Modulation and Demodulation of the Conventional AM.

-LAB 4-
-------

DSB-SC Modulation and Demodulation techniques have been performed.

-LAB 5-
-------

SSB Modulation and Demodulation techniques have been performed.

-LAB 6-
-------

FM Modulation and Demodulation techniques have been performed.

-LAB 7-
-------

Angle Modulation and Demodulation techniques have been performed.

-LAB 8-
-------

AM Modulation and Demodulation are performed with different noise signals on the message signal. For not getting the noise a filtering operation has been applied with a nonideal filter. After all, for seeing the performance of the filter the MSE function is written.

-LAB 9-
-------

FM Modulation and Demodulation are performed with different noise signals on the message signal. For not getting the noise a filtering operation has been applied with a nonideal filter. Lastly, the same MSE function that has been used in LAB 8 was used for examining the effect of the noise's SNR value on the message signal.
