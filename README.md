# Communication1-Labs
Here, I uploaded the codes that I have written during the Communication 1 lecture, which was given at the Ä°zmir Institute of Technology Electronics and Communication Department.

-LAB 1-
-------

In first lab's first part, we applied FFT to the message signals. In the second part we used MATLAB's ifft() function and performed IFFT by convolving signals and results have been tested by taking two results difference.

-LAB 2-
-------

First, we constructed given signals. After that, different types of filters applied on the constructed signals. The used filters are Ideal Low-Pass Filter, Ideal Band-Pass Filter and Butter Band-Pass Filter (nonideal).

-LAB 3-
-------

In lab 3, we practised Modulation and Demodulation of the Conventional AM.

-LAB 4-
